* PDP shows the marginal effect a feature has on the predicted outocme
* Partial dependence works by marginalizing the machine learning model output over the distribution of the features in set C, so that the function shows the relationship between the features in set S we are interested in and the predicted outcome. By marginalizing over the other features, we get a function that depends only on features in S, interactions with other features included.
* The partial function tells us for given value(s) of features S what the average marginal effect on the prediction is.
*  An assumption of the PDP is that the features in C are not correlated with the features in S. If this assumption is violated, the averages calculated for the partial dependence plot will include data points that are very unlikely or even impossible

* The computation of partial dependence plots is intuitive: The partial dependence function at a particular feature value represents the average prediction if we force all data points to assume that feature value. In my experience, lay people usually understand the idea of PDPs quickly.
* If the feature for which you computed the PDP is not correlated with the other features, then the PDPs perfectly represent how the feature influences the prediction on average. In the uncorrelated case, the interpretation is clear: The partial dependence plot shows how the average prediction in your dataset changes when the j-th feature is changed. It is more complicated when features are correlated, see also disadvantages.
Disadv
* Some PD plots do not show the feature distribution. Omitting the distribution can be misleading, because you might overinterpret regions with almost no data. This problem is easily solved by showing a rug (indicators for data points on the x-axis) or a histogram.
* The assumption of independence is the biggest issue with PD plots. It is assumed that the feature(s) for which the partial dependence is computed are not correlated with other features. For example, suppose you want to predict how fast a person walks, given the person's weight and height. For the partial dependence of one of the features, e.g. height, we assume that the other features (weight) are not correlated with height, which is obviously a false assumption
* Heterogeneous effects might be hidden because PD plots only show the average marginal effects. Suppose that for a feature half your data points have a positive association with the prediction -- the larger the feature value the larger the prediction -- and the other half has a negative association -- the smaller the feature value the larger the prediction. The PD curve could be a horizontal line, since the effects of both halves of the dataset could cancel each other out.
